# Computer Vision Code

I made these codes on Google Colab & Export into python file.
I made a list for these files to easily study step by step.

1. [CV2 Basics](/cv2_tutorials.py)
2. [CV2 Contours & Mask, thresholding](cv2_contours.py)
3. [Filters 2D](filters.py)
4. [Edge Detections](edge_detections.py)
5. [Scale Invariant Feature Transform](sift.py)
6. [Scanning Exam Bubble Sheet - OMR](bubble_exam_sheet_omr.py)
7. [Image Segmentation with K Means Clustering](image_segmentation_with_k_means_clustering.py)
8. [CIFAR 10 Image Classification with Tensorflow](cifar_10_image_classification.py)
9. [Snake Classification in Keras using VGG16](Using_VGG16_for_Snake_Classification.ipynb)
10. [Using Resnet50 pretrained model for classification](Using_Resnet50_pretrained_model.ipynb)
11. [Generative Adverserial Network fro MNIST](gan_for_mnist.py)

Technologies included - python, opencv2, imutils, matplotlib, tensorflow, keras
